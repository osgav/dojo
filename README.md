 Have you heard this one before?

some resistance -

And things seem hard or tough
i slept right next  to a snake,
that in unaccounted love remains
the time comes to introduce her
In the Florida Everglades,
It has ceased to be.
Dragged to the village paddy field with claps
Trying to survey from the tops of pine trees,
And mercilessly crushes the spirit.

You're a Burmese python,
```
